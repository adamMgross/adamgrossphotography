I am currently a Software Engineer at Google in Venice Beach, California. My undergraduate studies were in Computer Science, Math, and History with a concentration in the Middle East and North Africa. In addition to those academic areas, I also love all of the following (in no particular order):

* Backpacking and Hiking
* Nature Photography
* Tea
* Philosophy
* Mathematics -- probability, algorithms, topology, number theory
* Jazz and Bossa Nova
* Mindfulness
* Anthropology
* Theology and Religion
* Acoustics
* Sports and Sports Analytics
* Politics, especially Foreign Politics and Media Politics
* Behavioral Science
* Entrepreneurship and  Technology Business Strategy
* Business Administration
* Logistics Management/Strategy
* Travel
* Surrealist, Impressionist, Art Deco, and related art

For me, *"interesting"* **does not** mean *"agreeable"*. I am a strong independent and value ideological diversity. I strive to expose myself to ideas that span the entire political spectrum, and am constantly re-assessing my political sentiments. I am consistently inconsistent. I am an aware and skeptical user of some social media, and avid critic of technology that does not adhere to the concepts put forward in [digital wellbeing](https://wellbeing.google/), [humane technology](http://humanetech.com/), and [digital minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515).

Some of my most prominent photography idols and influencers are:
* Ansel Adams
* QT Luong
* Galen Rowell
* Bob Kaufman
* Vern Clevenger
* Erin Babnik
* Tom Till
* Sarah Marino
* Patricia Davidson
* Colleen Miniuk
* Sean Bagshaw
* Michael Frye
