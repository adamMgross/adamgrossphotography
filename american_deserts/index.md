I did not choose the desert, I was born into it. As a child, I spent my summers at dry, brush-covered camps, and road tripped around the Mojave more times than I can count. When I was young, I viewed it with disdain - it was hot, dusty, barren, and unfriendly. However, along with fond memories of youth comes involuntary love for its setting.

The Mojave is the closest in distance to my home of all of the places featured in this book, and as I grow older I come to love it more and more. It is beautiful in its diversity - sand dunes, Joshua Trees, cacti, and mountains converge and diverge throughought the landscape yielding endless opportunities for exploration. It is the perfect complement to the Sierra Nevada, since the arrival of snow to the mountains makes them unhikable, while the arrival of cooler temperatures makes the desert more likeable. With these two places, I have year-round entertainment.

The Mojave is just one part of an incredible neighborhood of deserts of which I am blessed to be a resident. I have only explored the other areas on very time-constrained trips, but in my time there I have been awestruck by what I have witnessed. I am hell-bent on achieving a deeper engagement with these areas, the type of engagement that can only blossom by not being rushed. I am overwhelmed by the amount of beauty present in the five deserts here in the American West, and I am excited that I have the rest of my life to explore them.
