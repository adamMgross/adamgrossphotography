As a California-based nature enthusiast, Hawaii offers a world of opposites to me. In contrast to Californiaâ€™s hard rocks, hot and dry deserts, smog pollution, and light pollution, Hawaii is wet, muddy, breezy, lush, and fresh. As a remote island chain in the middle of the largest ocean on the planet, Hawaii boasts the cleanest air I have had the privilege of breathing. This results in color gradients in the sky more vivid than anywhere else I have ever seen. This vividness, combined with the lush flora, freshly sculpted land, serene scent of humid tropical air, imposing volcanic peaks, and overwhelmingly starry nights makes Hawaii a truly special place for me. Coming back as an adult with an increased appreciation for natural wonder was an incredible journey of rediscovery.
