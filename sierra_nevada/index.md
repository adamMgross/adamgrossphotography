The Sierra Nevada earns its spot as the initial section of this book because it places first among all natural areas in every way that matters most to me. It is endlessly explorable by foot and by car, and the time I have spent among its high peaks, waterfalls, lakes, creeks, and wildlife has produced incredible memories and spiritual enlightenment. Fortunately, Los Angeles is very well positioned in relation to the Sierra Nevada, since the western and eastern sides are equidistant from here. When I witness the granite cliffs, powerful waterfalls, and heavenly high alpine meadows and lakes that are accessible in the warm season, I feel like I am a privileged guest in Mother Nature’s palace. While the winter is equally incredible in the Sierra, the thaw of the snow and the summer revelation of frighteningly powerful rivers, glorious meadows, and world class hiking trails to epic peaks and grand vistas is a blessing to all who accept the invitation to nature’s annual party here.

The photos in this section are ordered south-to-north, as this is the perspective that I have of the range from my home in Los Angeles. A view of Mount Whitney from Lone Pine is about a three hour drive for me, while the depths of Yosemite Valley and the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne are about six hours away. I am blessed to have had the experiences in the Sierra Nevada that I have, and I am even more excited for the many more that I will have in the future.
